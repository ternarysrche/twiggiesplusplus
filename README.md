## Inspiration
As passionate musicians, we were eager to develop an interactive project that incorporated everything necessary: fun, creativity, and melodic freedom.
## What it does
Press together any of your 4 fingers on either hand and try to play a scale!
## How we built it
Used Python and MediaPipe library for our pre-trained AI hand model, Used Flask & Tailwind CSS to integrate our hand model webcam into a website.
## Challenges we ran into
Implementing the changes to allow the user to play with both hands was difficult. Lots of debugging went into that process.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building everything from the ground up!
## What's next for our project
Hand gestures for changing octaves, options to change MIDI/instrument, improved website interface.
